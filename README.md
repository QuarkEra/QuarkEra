- 👋 Hi, I’m @QuarkEra
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development. After being bitten by the bug while learning C# for those auto splitter scripts, I found I missed all the planning and prototyping. After achieving my BSc in mathematics & physics in my spare time (7 years alongside a full-time night shift), I now desire more from work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with LinkedIn Premium "Become a Python Developer" 27 hour Learning Path - https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-python-developer-8969630
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything within my skill range or interests
- 📫 How to reach me ... here, of course - or Discord/Twitch, I have never been a fan of modern social media...
