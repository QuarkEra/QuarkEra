- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @QuarkEra
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software Development. After being bitten by the bug while learning C# for those auto splitter scripts, I found I missed all the planning and prototyping. After achieving my BSc in mathematics & physics in my spare time (7 years alongside a full-time night shift), I spend my spare time learning programming more diligently.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently studying The Odin Project for web development to build a Portfolio Of Work, the Portfolio will showcase my past projects and whatever I attempt in the future, follow that progress in the repos as a website or by my pushed commits.
