- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @QuarkEra
- ðŸŒ± OOP C++ text adventure terminal program, built in VS22. Started from Zenva "Learn Object-Oriented C++ by Building a Game" and will make more additions using OOP concepts. Added NPC subclass and started inventory/item management.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software Development. After being bitten by the bug while learning C# for those auto splitter scripts, I found I missed all the planning and prototyping. After achieving my BSc in mathematics & physics in my spare time (7 years alongside a full-time night shift), I spend my spare time learning programming more diligently.
